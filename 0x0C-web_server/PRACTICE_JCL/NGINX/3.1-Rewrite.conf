# In NGINX, the -> rewrite <- directive is used to modify or change the requested URL.
# It is often employed for URL redirection or modification based on specific conditions.
# Below is a basic example of using the rewrite directive in NGINX configuration:


server {
    listen 80;

    location /old-url {
        rewrite ^/old-url/(.*)$ /new-url/$1 permanent;
    }

    location /new-url {
        # Your configuration for the new URL goes here
        # For example, proxy_pass or root directive
    }

    # Additional server configuration...
}
# In this example:

# Requests to /old-url/some-page will be redirected permanently to /new-url/some-page.
# The rewrite directive uses a regular expression to match the part of the URL after /old-url/ and appends it to the new URL.
# Adjust the configuration based on your specific use case and requirements.
# The rewrite directive provides flexibility for handling URL modifications within NGINX.
